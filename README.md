dictionary
==========

a small python script that takes input file turns it into a dictionary and with that you can practise foreign languages



you have it give a file in the same dictionary with words and its definitions with a delimiter in between (could be txt or csv does not really matter) 
my delimiter is tilde (~) so find and replace it with yours
the line files must be consistent top-down .


make a directory (folder) with the dictionary.py and the text file with word definitions and then run the ./dictionary.py
